Features:

- A generic client for the [access-control-srv](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv).
- It uses [grpc-client](https://github.com/restorecommerce/grpc-client) to access the exposed API via its gRPC interface.
- It constructs the [request](https://github.com/restorecommerce/acs-client#accessrequest) object expected by `access-control-srv` when requesting access to a particular [resource](https://github.com/restorecommerce/acs-client#accessrequest) with a specific action on it.
- It supports access requests for both methods [isAllowed](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) and [whatIsAllowed](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#whatisallowed) exposed by `access-control-srv`.
- It provides an optional caching mechanism for the two operations based on a [redis](https://redis.io/) store.
- It evaluates the [condition](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#rule) for `whatIsAllowed` requests.
- It returns the decision made by the ACS.

## Configuration

The `access-control-srv` [URN configurations](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv/blob/master/restorecommerce_ABAC.md#urn-reference) needs to be set using [authorization](cfg/config.json#L106) configuration to `acs-client` from access requesting microservice.
The URN for the [role scoping entity](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv/blob/master/restorecommerce_ABAC.md#role-scoping) for Organization/ business units must be set using the configuration property `authorization.urns.orgScope`.

`orgScope: 'urn:\<organization\>:acs:model:<Entity_Name>`

ex: `orgScope: urn:restorecommerce:acs:model:organization.Organization`

The caching configurations for `redis` can be set using [`authorization:cache`](cfg/config.json#L148) configuration.

For testing and debugging the access control checking can be dsiabled as a whole via the [`enabled`](cfg/config.json#L108) flag. This will supress the access control checking via the ACS and always permit any request.
If the ACS checks should be performed (and thus logged) but not enforced, the [`enforce`](cfg/config.json#L109) flag can be set to false which is useful for debugging the ruleset.

It is also possible to configure [`authorization:unauthenticated_user`](cfg/config.json#L155) as subject with identifiter and token in the configuration, if the subject is empty then the token from this configuration will be used.

## API

The client exposes the following API:

### `accessRequest`

It turns an API request as can be found in typical Web frameworks like [express](https://expressjs.com/), [koa](https://koajs.com/#introduction) etc. into a proper ACS request. Depending on `Operation` respective api's [isAllowed](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) and [whatIsAllowed](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#whatisallowed) are invoked from [access-control-srv](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv).
Requests are performed providing `Request` message as input and response is `Response` message type. For the read operations it extends the filter provided in the `ReadRequst` of the input message to enforce the applicapble poilicies. The response is `DecisionResponse` or policy set reverse query `PolicySetRQResponse` depending on the requeste operation `isAllowed()` or `whatIsAllowed()` respectively.

`Request`

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| subject | `io.restorecommerce.user.Subject` | required | Subject [user](https://github.com/restorecommerce/identity-srv#user) details (ID, token, role-associations and hierarchical scopes) |
| resource | `Resource [ ]` | required | contains resource name, resource instance and optional resource properties |

| ctx | `ACSClientContext` | required | context containing subject and context resources for ACS |

| database | string | optional | database used, currently 'arangoDB' and 'postgres' are supported |
| useCache | `boolean` | optional | defaults to `true`, if set to false then ACS cache is not used and ACS request is made to `access-control-srv` |

 `Response`

| Field | Type | Label | Description |

| DecisionResponse | `DecisionResponse` | optional | Access decision; possible values are `PERMIT`, `DENY` or `INDETERMINATE` |
| PolicySetRQResponse | `PolicySetRQResponse [ ]` | optional | List of applicable policy sets along with obligations if any |

`Resource`

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| resource | string | requried | resource entity or operation name |
| id | string | optional | instance identifier of the resource |
| property | string [ ] | optional | list of fields for accessing or modifying resource |

`ACSClientContext`

### `isAllowed`

This API exposes the [`isAllowed`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) api of `access-control-srv` and retruns the response as `Decision`.
Requests are performed providing [`io.restorecommerce.access_control.Request`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) message as input and response is [`io.restorecommerce.access_control.Response`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) message.

### `whatIsAllowed`

This API exposes the [`whatIsAllowed`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#whatisallowed) api of `access-control-srv` and retruns policy sets list containing list of applicable policies and rules. Requests are performed providing [`io.restorecommerce.access_control.Request`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#whatisallowed) message as input and response is [`io.restorecommerce.access_control.ReverseQuery`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#whatisallowed) message.

## Caching

This client supports caching for `isAllowed` and `whatIsAllowed` access request operations if [`authorization:cache`](cfg/config.json#L148) options are set. The time to live for redis key can be set using [`authorization:cache:ttl`](cfg/config.json#L152) configuration. The hash key for caching the request is generated using [`MD5`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) hash algorithm. 
For `whatIsAllowed` operations `Request` Object is used to generate the hash key and for `isAllowed` operations [`io.restorecommerce.access_control.Target`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv#isallowed) Object is used since the resource data changes.
Each of the ACS request is associated with an ID of [`subject`](https://github.com/restorecommerce/access-control-srv/blob/master/restorecommerce_ABAC.md#xacml), this subject ID is included in the hash key as prefix to keep track of mapping between ACS requests and cached data.
The cache can be invalidated by invoking [`flushCache`](./src/acs/cache.ts#L104) api with subject ID as prefix parameter.
